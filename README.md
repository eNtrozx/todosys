## Abstract

This is an implemenation of a Todo system using Java and the Spring Framework.

The system enables managing a list of persons, tasks, and assignning task to people.

The system is built on top of 3 layers - Model View Controller, Service Layer, and JPA (Persistance Abstraction Layer).

## System Design

### Model View Controller

There are 2 controllers, one for managing people, availabe on `"/api/people"`, and one for maanging tasks, avialble on `"/api/tasks"`. The controllers provide various methopds for CRUD operation on the objects, such as `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, etc.

The controllers also provide a lof of execption handling methods, such as when a requested object is not found, automatically transfoprming the rersponse type accordingly, e.g. status 404 for not found.

### Service Layer

The service layers provides the business logic and interaction with the repositories. In this system, we have 2 services, `PeopleService` and `TasksService`, each handling their respective responsibilities.

### JPA

This is an abstraction layer for the H2 embedded database. This abstraction provides us with easy Java methods that replace traditional SQL queries, such as `getPersonByEmail(String email)`.

In this system, we have 2 repositores, `TaskRepo` and `PersonRepo`, where all the tasks are stored in a tasks table which is managed by `TaskRepo` and the same goes for `PersonRepo`.
